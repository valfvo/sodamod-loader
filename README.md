# SodaMod
SodaMod is a free, open-source modding API for [Soda Dungeon 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/946050/Soda_Dungeon_2/). It allows players to create and play as many mods as they want. SodaMod has been carefully designed to provide an elegant way to extend and modify the base features of the game, while trying to minimize conflicts between multiple mods.
